# Pandas Challenge 

## Data analysis of the game named Heroes of Pymoli 

## Data Set Name: Purchase Data

## From the Purchase Data, we will:
1. Calculate the total number of players
2. Realize a purchasing analysis (Total)
3. Realize a gender demographics analysis
4. Realize a purchasing analysis by gender type
5. Analyze the distribution of players by age
6. Realize a  purchasing analysis age
7. Determine the top 5 spenders 
8. Determine the top 5 most popular items
9. Determine the top 5 most profitable items

## Observable Trends:
-  The majority of the players are male, representing at least 84.03% of the total players.
- Even though the total number of male players is greater than the total number of female players, those last ones (female players) have a more significant average total Purchase per Person which is $4.47 versus $4.07 for male players.
- The great majority of players are between 20-24 years old, and they represent 44.79% of the total population of players.
