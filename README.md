## Data Set Name: Purchase Data

## From the Purchase Data, we will:
1. Calculate the total number of players.
2. Realize a purchasing analysis (Total).
3. Realize a gender demographics analysis.
4. Realize a purchassing analysis by gender type.
5. Analyze the distribution of players by age.
6. Realize a purchassing analysis age.
7. Determine the top 5 spenders.
8. Determine the top 5 most popular items.
9. Determine the top 5 most profitable items.


## Observable Trends: 
- The majority of the players are male, representing at least 84.03% of the total players.
- Even though the total number of male players is greater than the total number of female players, those last ones (female players) have a more significant average total purchase per person which is $4.47 versus $4.07 for male players.
- The great majority of players are between 20-24 years old, and they represent 44.79% of the total population of players.
